Welcome to a bodged together version of Monopoly developed purely using Cpp and the graphics.h library.

This is not a fully functional game and only developed as a mini-project to showcase the understanding of basic graphical algorithms.

If you would like to run this on your system, you'll need DosBox and the BGI folder. I used [Turbo-C++](https://turboc.me/download-turbo-c-file/).

Before compiling and executing make sure to change the value inside the initgraph (line 329), to the absolute location of the BGI folder. <br>
Also, update the location of Places.txt inside fetchData function (line 370).

Thank you for reading.
